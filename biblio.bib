This column uses three criteria to compare the languages: the power of available libraries, the speed and possibilities when handling large datasets, and the speed and ease-of-use for a computationally intensive task. While R is still a good choice, Julia is the language the authors now tend to pick for new projects and generally recommend.}

Our main findings are as follows: (i) permanent changes in government purchases can lead to short-run and long-run output multipliers that exceed 1; (ii) permanent changes in government purchases induce larger effects than temporary changes; (iii) the financing decision is quantitatively more important than the resource cost of changes in government purchases; and (iv) public investment has dramatic effects on private output and investment. These findings stem from important dynamic interactions of capital and labor absent in earlier equilibrium analyses of fiscal policy.}

Part II presents basics from numerical analysis on R\^n, including linear equations, iterative methods, optimization, nonlinear equations, approximation methods, numerical integration and differentiation, and Monte Carlo methods. Part III covers methods for dynamic problems, including finite difference methods, projection methods, and numerical dynamic programming. Part IV covers perturbation and asymptotic solution methods. Finally, Part V covers applications to dynamic equilibrium analysis, including solution methods for perfect foresight models and rational expectation models.

  abstract = {This paper presents the neoclassical model of capital accumulation augmented by choice of labor supply as the basic framework of modern real business cycle analysis. Preferences and production possibilities are restricted so that the economy displays steady state growth. Then we explore the implications of the basic model for perfect foresight capital accumulation and for economic fluctuations initiated by impulses to technology. We argue that the neoclassical approach holds considerable promise for enhancing our understanding of fluctuations. Nevertheless, the basic model does have some important shortcomings. In particular, substantial persistence in technology shocks is required if the model economy is to exhibit periods of economic activity that persistently deviate from a deterministic trend.}

  abstract = {The methods used in our two survey papers on real business cycles (King,Plosser and Rebelo, 1988a,b) are detailed in this document. Our presentationof the basic neoclassical model of growth and business cycles is broken intothree parts. First, we describe the model and its steady state, discussing:the structure of the environment including government policy rules; the natureof optimal individual decisions and the dynamic competitive equilibrium;technical restrictions to insure steady state growth; comparable restrictionson preferences and policy rules; stationary levels and ratios in the steadystate; and the nature of a transformed economy. Second, we detail methods forstudying near steady-state dynamics, considering: the linear approximationapproach; the rational expectations solution algorithm; the nature ofalternative solutions; and the special case of the fixed labor model. Third,we discuss the computation of simulations, moments and impulse responses.The objective of this appendix is to provide a detailed analysis of aneoclassical economy that is sufficiently flexible to permit: (a) exogenoussteady state growth; (b) distorting tax rules of various sorts; and (c) timevarying government spending. Although we do not focus on all of these issuesin the present discussion, other investigations in progress will utilize thisframework. The appendix is divided into three main parts. Part A describes theartificial economy under study and analyses its steady state, Part B developsmethods to study approximate dynamics around the steady state, and Part Cderives a set of formulas for generating population moments. This technicalappendix is designed to serve two functions. First, it develops thetheoretical material in Sections 2 and 3 of the main text in more depths.Second, it serves as a detailed guide to PC-MATLAB programs for computingdynamic equilibria, written by King and Rebelo in the Spring of 1987. Notation in programs and the technical appendix has been detailed as closely as feasible.}

Yet, there is increasing skepticism that technology shocks are a major source of business fluctuations. This chapter exposits the basic RBC model and shows that it requires large technology shocks to produce realistic business cycles. While Solow residuals are sufficiently volatile, these imply frequent technological regress. Productivity studies permitting unobserved factor variation find much smaller technology shocks, suggesting the imminent demise of real business cycles. However, we show that greater factor variation also dramatically amplifies shocks: a RBC model with varying capital utilization yields realistic business cycles from small, nonnegative changes in technology.},

(Examples of such models are new Keynesian models, life-cycle models, heterogeneous-agents models, asset-pricing models, multisector models, multicountry models, and climate change models.) First, we describe the ingredients that help us to reduce the cost of global solution methods. These are efficient nonproduct techniques for interpolating and approximating functions (Smolyak, stochastic simulation, and -distinguishable set grids), accurate low-cost monomial integration formulas, derivative-free solvers, and numerically stable regression methods. Second, we discuss endogenous grid and envelope condition methods that reduce the cost and increase accuracy of value function iteration. Third, we show precomputation techniques that construct solution manifolds for some models' variables outside the main iterative cycle. Fourth, we review techniques that increase the accuracy of perturbation methods: a change of variables and a hybrid of local and global solutions. Finally, we show examples of parallel computation using multiple CPUs and GPUs including applications on a supercomputer. We illustrate the performance of the surveyed methods using a multiagent model. Many codes are publicly available.}
