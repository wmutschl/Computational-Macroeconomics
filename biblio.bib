  abstract = {Dynare is a software platform for handling a wide class of economic models, in particular dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and overlapping generations (OLG) models. The models solved by Dynare include those relying on the rational expectations hypothesis, wherein agents form their expectations about the future in a way consistent with the model. But Dynare is also able to handle models where expectations are formed differently: on one extreme, models where agents perfectly anticipate the future; on the other extreme, models where agents have limited rationality or imperfect knowledge of the state of the economy and, hence, form their expectations through a learning process. Dynare offers a user-friendly and intuitive way of describing these models. It is able to perform simulations of the model given a calibration of the model parameters and is also able to estimate these parameters given a dataset. Dynare is a free software, which means that it can be downloaded free of charge, that its source code is freely available, and that it can be used for both non-profit and for-profit purposes.},

Non-partisan in its approach, it deals with all the major topics, summarising the important approaches and providing the reader with a coherent angle on all aspects of macroeconomic thought. Each chapter deals with a separate area of macroeconomics, and each contains a summary section of key points and a further reading list. Using nothing more than undergraduate mathematical skills, it takes the student from basic IS-LM style macro models to the state of the art literature on Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium, explaining the mathematical tricks used where they are first introduced. Fully updated and substantially revised, this third edition of Foundations of Modern Macroeconomics now includes brand new chapters covering highly topical subjects such as dynamic programming, competitive risk sharing equilibria and the New Keynesian DSGE approach. --},

Preferences and production possibilities are restricted so that the economy displays steady state growth. Then we explore the implications of the basic model for perfect foresight capital accumulation and for economic fluctuations initiated by impulses to technology. We argue that the neoclassical approach holds considerable promise for enhancing our understanding of fluctuations. Nevertheless, the basic model does have some important shortcomings. In particular, substantial persistence in technology shocks is required if the model economy is to exhibit periods of economic activity that persistently deviate from a deterministic trend.}

Our presentationof the basic neoclassical model of growth and business cycles is broken intothree parts. First, we describe the model and its steady state, discussing:the structure of the environment including government policy rules; the natureof optimal individual decisions and the dynamic competitive equilibrium;technical restrictions to insure steady state growth; comparable restrictionson preferences and policy rules; stationary levels and ratios in the steadystate; and the nature of a transformed economy. Second, we detail methods forstudying near steady-state dynamics, considering: the linear approximationapproach; the rational expectations solution algorithm; the nature ofalternative solutions; and the special case of the fixed labor model. Third,we discuss the computation of simulations, moments and impulse responses.The objective of this appendix is to provide a detailed analysis of aneoclassical economy that is sufficiently flexible to permit: (a) exogenoussteady state growth; (b) distorting tax rules of various sorts; and (c) timevarying government spending. Although we do not focus on all of these issuesin the present discussion, other investigations in progress will utilize thisframework. The appendix is divided into three main parts. Part A describes theartificial economy under study and analyses its steady state, Part B developsmethods to study approximate dynamics around the steady state, and Part Cderives a set of formulas for generating population moments. This technicalappendix is designed to serve two functions. First, it develops thetheoretical material in Sections 2 and 3 of the main text in more depths.Second, it serves as a detailed guide to PC-MATLAB programs for computingdynamic equilibria, written by King and Rebelo in the Spring of 1987. Notation in programs and the technical appendix has been detailed as closely as feasible.}

While Solow residuals are sufficiently volatile, these imply frequent technological regress. Productivity studies permitting unobserved factor variation find much smaller technology shocks, suggesting the imminent demise of real business cycles. However, we show that greater factor variation also dramatically amplifies shocks: a RBC model with varying capital utilization yields realistic business cycles from small, nonnegative changes in technology.},

(Examples of such models are new Keynesian models, life-cycle models, heterogeneous-agents models, asset-pricing models, multisector models, multicountry models, and climate change models.) First, we describe the ingredients that help us to reduce the cost of global solution methods. These are efficient nonproduct techniques for interpolating and approximating functions (Smolyak, stochastic simulation, and -distinguishable set grids), accurate low-cost monomial integration formulas, derivative-free solvers, and numerically stable regression methods. Second, we discuss endogenous grid and envelope condition methods that reduce the cost and increase accuracy of value function iteration. Third, we show precomputation techniques that construct solution manifolds for some models' variables outside the main iterative cycle. Fourth, we review techniques that increase the accuracy of perturbation methods: a change of variables and a hybrid of local and global solutions. Finally, we show examples of parallel computation using multiple CPUs and GPUs including applications on a supercomputer. We illustrate the performance of the surveyed methods using a multiagent model. Many codes are publicly available.}
