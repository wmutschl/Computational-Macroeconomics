\section[The Algebra of New Keynesian Models]{The Algebra of New Keynesian Models\label{ex:AlgebraNewKeynesianModels}}
Consider a New Keynesian (NK) model with capital, subject to investment-adjustment costs, and \textcite{Calvo_1983_StaggeredPricesUtilitymaximizing} price frictions.
The model is populated by a continuum of households \(h \in [0,n]\), final goods firms \(f \in [0,n]\), and intermediate goods firms \(m \in [0,n]\),
  as well as a fiscal authority and a central bank.\footnote{%
  Because we are looking at a closed-economy, in many papers and textbooks one typically normalizes \(n=1\),
    thereby aligning per-capita variables with their corresponding total aggregates.
}

\subsection{Households: description}

\paragraph{Utility}
The household's preferences are defined over consumption \(C_{t}[h]\) and labor effort \(L^{s}_t[h]\),
  so that they maximize present as well as expected future utility:
\begin{align}
	\max \mathbb{E}_{t} \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \beta^{j} \mu_{t+j} U(C_{t+j}[h], L^{s}_{t+j}[h]) \label{eq:NewKeynesian.UtilityLifetime}
\end{align}
\(\mathbb{E}_{t}\) is the expectation operator conditional on information at time \(t\)
  and \(\mu_{t}\) denotes an exogenous shifter to the discount factor \(\beta <1\)
that evolves according to:
\begin{align}
\log{\mu_{t}} &= \rho^{\mu} \log{\mu_{t-1}} + \varepsilon^{\mu}_{t} \label{eq:NewKeynesian.LoM.PreferenceShifter}
\end{align}
where \(\rho^{\mu}\) is the persistence of the law of motion
  and \(\varepsilon^{\mu}_{t}\) is an exogenous deviation to the process.

Consider the following functional form for the contemporaneous utility function
\begin{align}
U(C_{t}[h], L^{s}_{t}[h]) = \frac{{\left(C_{t}[h]\right)}^{1-\sigma^{C}}}{1-\sigma^{C}} - \chi^{L} \frac{{\left(L^{s}_{t}[h]\right)}^{1+\sigma^{L}}}{1+\sigma^{L}} \label{eq:NewKeynesian.UtilityMomentary}
\end{align}
Note that the marginal utility of consumption is positive,
  whereas more labor reduces utility.
Moreover, the chosen utility function~\eqref{eq:NewKeynesian.UtilityMomentary} is concave.

\paragraph{Capital accumulation}
The household owns (end of period) capital stock \(K_{t}[h]\) which evolves according to
\begin{align}
K_{t}[h] &= (1-\delta^{K}) K_{t-1}[h] + \Biggl( 1 - \frac{\phi^{I}}{2} {\left(\frac{I_{t}[h]}{I_{t-1}[h]} - 1 \right)}^2 \Biggr) I_{t}[h] \label{eq:NewKeynesian.CapitalAccumulation}
\end{align}
where \(\delta \) is the depreciation rate and \(\phi^{I} \geq 0\) scales the quadratic investment-adjustment costs.

\paragraph{Nominal budget}
Capital is rented to the intermediate firms at a nominal rate of \(R^{K}_{t}\) which the household takes as given when forming optimal plans.
Similarly, in each period the household takes the nominal wage \(W_{t}\) as given
  and supplies perfectly elastic labor service \(L^{s}_{t}[h]\) to the firm sector.
In return they receive nominal labor income \(W_t L^{s}_{t}[h]\).
Households own the firms, and thus, they equally receive nominal profits (dividends)
  from each firm \(f\in[0,n]\) in the final goods sector, denoted as \(\mathcal{DIV}^{F}_{t}[f]\),
  as well as from each firm \(m\in[0,n]\) in the intermediate goods sector, represented by \(\mathcal{DIV}^{M}_{t}[m]\).
In the financial realm, households have access to a full set of state-contingent zero-coupon bonds.
Specifically, define \(\mathcal{S}\) as the complete set of future states of the world,
  then \(P^{\mathcal{B}}_{t}[\mathtt{s}']\) represents the price at time \(t\) of a bond that will pay one unit of money at time \(t+1\)
  if the \emph{potential future state} \(\mathcal{\mathtt{s}' \in \mathcal{S}}\) materializes.
The quantity of such bonds purchased by household \(h\) at time \(t\) is denoted by \(\mathcal{B}_{t}[\mathtt{s}',h]\),
  whereas \(\mathcal{B}_{t-1}[\mathtt{s},h]\) indicates the value of the household's existing claims based on the realized state \(\mathtt{s}\).
The gross return on the bond in \emph{realized state} \(\mathtt{s}\) is defined by:
\begin{align}
R_{t} = \frac{1}{P^{\mathcal{B}}_{t-1}[\mathtt{s}]} \label{eq:NewKeynesian.BondPriceInterestRate}
\end{align}
On the expenditure front, the household allocates resources to consumption \(C_{t}[h]\) and investment \(I_{t}[h]\),
  all priced at the consumer price index \(P_{t}\),
  and pays lump-sum tax obligations \(\mathcal{T}_{t}[h]\) to the fiscal authority.
In total this defines the \emph{nominal} budget constraint of the household:
\begin{multline}
  \underbrace{R^{K}_{t} K_{t-1}[h]}_{\text{capital income}}
+ \underbrace{W_{t} L^{s}_{t}[h]}_{\text{labor income}}
+ \underbrace{%
    \frac{1}{n} \int_{0}^{n} \mathcal{DIV}^{F}_{t}[f] df
  + \frac{1}{n} \int_{0}^{n} \mathcal{DIV}^{M}_{t}[m] dm
}_{\text{firm profits}}
\\
=
\underbrace{%
\sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} P^{\mathcal{B}}_{t}[s'] \mathcal{B}_{t}[s',h]
- \mathcal{B}_{t-1}[s,h]
}_{\text{state-contingent bonds}}
+ \underbrace{P_{t} C_{t}[h] + P_{t} I_{t}[h]}_{\text{good expenditures}}
+
\underbrace{\mathcal{T}_{t}[h]}_{\text{taxes}}
\label{eq:NewKeynesian.BudgetNominal}
\end{multline}

\paragraph{Transversality and solvency conditions}
It is assumed that the household is subject to the following transversality condition:
\begin{align*}
\lim_{j \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb{E}_{t} \left \{\mathcal{M}_{t,t+j} K_{t+j}[h] \right \} = 0
\end{align*}
and solvency constraint that prevents it from engaging in Ponzi-type schemes:
\begin{align*}
\lim_{T \rightarrow \infty} &\mathbb{E}_{t} \left \{\mathcal{M}_{t,t+j} \frac{\mathcal{B}_{t+j}[h]}{P_{t+j}} \right \} \geq 0
\end{align*}
for all periods \(t\), where \(\mathcal{M}_{t,t+j}\) denotes the stochastic discount factor.

\paragraph{Notation}
In what follows, let lower case letters denote \emph{real} variables in \emph{per-capita} terms:
\begin{gather*}
c_{t} := \frac{1}{n}\int_{0}^{n} C_{t}[h] dh
,\quad
i_{t} := \frac{1}{n}\int_{0}^{n} I_{t}[h] dh
,\quad
k_{t} := \frac{1}{n}\int_{0}^{n} K_{t}[h] dh
,\quad
l^{s}_{t} := \frac{1}{n}\int_{0}^{n} L^{s}_{t}[h] dh
\\
\mathtt{b}_{t} := \frac{1}{n}\int_{0}^{n} \frac{\mathcal{B}_{t}[h]}{P_{t}} dh
,\quad
\tau_{t} := \frac{1}{n}\int_{0}^{n} \frac{\mathcal{T}_{t}[h]}{P_{t}} dh
\end{gather*}
Similarly, lower case letters denote real factor prices:
\begin{align*}
w_{t} := \frac{W_{t}}{P_{t}},
\quad
r^{K}_{t} := \frac{R^{K}_{t}}{P_t},
\end{align*}
and consumer price inflation is given by \(\Pi_{t} = P_{t}/P_{t-1}\).
We denote the marginal utilities with respect to consumption and labor as:
\begin{gather*}
U_{C,t} := \frac{\partial U(C_{t}[h],L^{s}_{t}[h])}{\partial C_{t}[h]},
\quad
U_{L,t} := \frac{\partial U(C_{t}[h],L^{s}_{t}[h])}{\partial L^{s}_{t}[h]},
\\
U_{CC,t} := \frac{\partial^2 U(C_{t}[h],L^{s}_{t}[h])}{\partial C_{t}[h] \partial C_{t}[h]},
\quad
U_{CL,t} := \frac{\partial^2 U(C_{t}[h],L^{s}_{t}[h])}{\partial C_{t}[h] \partial L^{s}_{t}[h]},
\quad
U_{LL,t} := \frac{\partial^2 U(C_{t}[h],L^{s}_{t}[h])}{\partial L^{s}_{t}[h] \partial L^{s}_{t}[h]}
\end{gather*}

\end{align}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Final goods firms: description}
A firm \(f \in [0,n]\) synthesizes a continuum of differentiated intermediate wholesale goods \(Y_{t}[f,m]\) with \(m \in [0,n]\),
  to compile the bundle of final goods \(Y_{t}[f]\) that can be used for consumption, investment and government spending.
As these distinct varieties are blended into the final good,
  the aggregation unfolds under conditions of perfect competition,
  where the firm \(f\) acts as a \emph{price taker}.

\paragraph{Aggregation technology}
The following constant elasticity of substitute (CES) technology is available to firm \(f\) for aggregating differentiated varieties:
\begin{align}
Y_{t}[f] = {\left({\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)}^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon^{P}}} \int_{0}^{n} {(Y_{t}[f,m])}^{\frac{\epsilon^{P}-1}{\epsilon^{P}}} dm\right)}^{\frac{\epsilon^{P}}{\epsilon^{P}-1}} \label{eq:NewKeynesian.Firms.Aggregator}
\end{align}
where \(\epsilon^{P}>1\) is the intratemporal elasticity of substitution between differentiated varieties.

\paragraph{Cost minimization}
The aggregator \(f\) takes the listed price \(P_{t}[m]\) of intermediate good \(m\) as fixed input
  while determining the optimal quantity of variety \(Y_{t}[f,m]\) to purchase.
The firm minimizes its nominal expenditures in compliance with the technology constraint.

\paragraph{Notation}
In what follows, let lower case letters denote \emph{real} variables in \emph{per-capita} terms:
\begin{align*}
y_{t} = \int_{0}^{1} Y_{t}[f] df
\end{align*}

\subsection{Final goods firms: exercises}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]

\item
Show that cost minimization in the final goods sector implies:
\begin{align}
Y_{t}[f,m] &= \frac{1}{n} {\left(\frac{P_{t}[m]}{P_{t}}\right)}^{-\epsilon^{P}} Y_{t}[f] \label{eq:NewKeynesian.Firms.Demand}
\\
1 &= \frac{1}{n} \int_{0}^{n} {\left(\frac{P_{t}[m]}{P_{t}}\right)}^{1-\varepsilon^{P}} dm \label{eq:NewKeynesian.Firms.AggregatePriceIndex}
\end{align}
Interpret the equations.

\item
Show that total demand for variety \(m\) is given by:
\begin{align}
Y^{d}_{t}[m] &:= \int_{0}^{n} Y_{t}[f,m] df = {\left(\frac{P_{t}[m]}{P_{t}}\right)}^{-\epsilon^{P}} y_{t} \label{eq:NewKeynesian.Firms.TotalDemand}
\end{align}

\item

\end{align}
What is the name of this equation?

\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\subsection{Intermediate goods firms: description}
The producers of differentiated products \(m \in [0,n]\) are called \emph{monopolists}
  because they operate within a framework of monopolistic competition.
This allows them some level of control over the pricing of their specific variety \(m\).
It is assumed that firms are owned by the households and any profits are re-distributed among all households in a per-capita fashion.

\paragraph{Production function}
Each intermediate firm \(m\) manufactures its distinct variety by blending labor \(l^{d}_{t}[m]\) and capital \(k^{d}_{t-1}[m]\),
  according to a Cobb-Douglas production function:
\begin{align}
Y^{s}_{t}[m] = A_{t} {(K^{d}_{t-1}[m])}^{\alpha^{K}} {(L^{d}_{t}[m])}^{1-\alpha^{K}} \label{eq:NewKeynesian.IntermediateFirms.ProductionFunction}
\end{align}
where \(\alpha^{K}\) is the elasticity towards capital in production.
\(A_{t}\) denotes the common technology level available to all firms which evolves according to:
\begin{align}
\log{A_{t}} &= (1-\rho^{A}) \log{\overline{A}} + \rho^{A} \log{A_{t-1}} + \varepsilon^{A}_{t} \label{eq:NewKeynesian.LoM.TFP}
\end{align}
where \(\overline{A}\) is the baseline level of productivity,
  \(\rho^{A}\) the persistence of the law of motion
  and \(\varepsilon^{A}_{t}\) an exogenous deviation to the process.

\paragraph{Profit maximization}
Monopolists face perfectly competitive factor markets and
  rent capital at nominal rate \(R^{K}_{t}\)
  and hire labor services at nominal wage \(W_{t}\).
They maximize profits subject to the production function
  and to the constraint of producing enough to meet total demand for their specific variety:
\begin{align*}
Y^{s}_{t}[m] \geq Y^{d}_{t}[m]
\end{align*}
The objective of the firm is to choose contingent plans for \(P_{t}[m]\), \(L^{d}_{t}[m]\) and \(K^{d}_{t-1}[m]\)
  so as to maximize the present discounted value of nominal profits.

\paragraph{Price setting}

Prices of intermediate goods are determined by nominal contracts as in \textcite{Calvo_1983_StaggeredPricesUtilitymaximizing} and \textcite{Yun_1996_NominalPriceRigidity}.
In each period monopolist \(m\) faces a constant probability \(1-\theta^{P}, 0\leq \theta^{P} \leq 1\),
  of being able to re-set the price \(P_{t}(f)\) of its good \(m\).
The probability is independent of the time it last reset its price.
Formally:
\begin{align}
P_{t}[m] = \begin{cases}
\widetilde{P}_{t}[m] & \text{with probability } 1-\theta^{P}\\
P_{t-1}[m] & \text{with probability } \theta^{P}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:NewKeynesian.CalvoMechanism}
\end{align}
\(\widetilde{P}_{t}[m]\) is the optimal reset price, decided in period \(t\), of intermediate good \(m\).
A firm granted the opportunity to adjust its price in period \(t\) strategically sets this price
  to maximize the expected present value of its profits until the next opportunity for price adjustment arises.
If the firm cannot change its price for \(j\) periods,
  its price in period \(t+j\) is given by \(\widetilde{P}_{t}[m]\)
  and stays there until the firm can re-optimize again.
The probability of facing such a scenario is \({(\theta^{P})}^{j}\).


\paragraph{Notation}
In what follows, let lower case letters denote \emph{real} variables in \emph{per-capita} terms:
\begin{align*}
k^{d}_{t} = \frac{1}{n} \int_{0}^{1} K^{d}_{t}[m] dm
,\quad
l^{d}_{t} = \frac{1}{n} \int_{0}^{1} L^{d}_{t}[m] dm
,\quad
{mc}_{t} = \frac{1}{n} \int_{0}^{1} {MC}_{t}[m] dm
\end{align*}
Similarly, lower case letters denote real factor prices and relative prices:
\begin{align*}
w_{t} := \frac{W_{t}}{P_{t}}
,\quad
r^{K}_{t} := \frac{R^{K}_{t}}{P_{t}}
,\quad
\widetilde{p}_{t} := \frac{\widetilde{P}_{t}[m]}{P_{t}}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Government: description}

\paragraph{Monetary policy}
The central bank adjusts the nominal interest rate \(R_t\) according to an interest rate rule
  in response to deviations of (i) gross inflation \(\Pi_{t}\) from a target \(\overline{\Pi}\)
  and (ii) per-capita output \(y_t\) from its steady-state value \(y\):
\begin{align}
\frac{R_{t}}{R} = {\left(\frac{R_{t-1}}{R}\right)}^{\rho^{R}} {\left({\left(\frac{\Pi_{t}}{\overline{\Pi}}\right)}^{\psi^{R_\Pi}} {\left(\frac{y_t}{y}\right)}^{\psi^{R_Y}}\right)}^{1-\rho^{R}} e^{\varepsilon^{R}_{t}} \label{eq:NewKeynesian.MonetaryPolicyRule}
\end{align}
where \(R\) denotes the nominal interest rate in steady-state,
  \(\rho^{R}\) is a persistence parameter,
  \(\psi^{R_\Pi}\) the sensitivity parameter to inflation deviations,
  and \(\psi^{R_Y}\) the feedback parameter of the output gap.
\(\varepsilon^{R}_{t}\) is an exogenous deviation to the rule.

\paragraph{Fiscal policy}
The fiscal authority levies lump-sum taxes \(\mathcal{T}_{t}[h]\) on households
  to finance government spending \(G_{t}\).
The nominal fiscal budget is given by:
\begin{align}
\int_{0}^{n} \mathcal{T}_{t}[h] dh = G_{t} \label{eq:NewKeynesian.FiscalBudgetNominal}
\end{align}
Real per-capita government spending, \(g_{t} = (1/n) G_{t}/P_{t}\) is determined by a fiscal rule
  in relation to steady-state output \(y\):
\begin{align}
\left(\frac{g_{t}}{y}\right) &= (1-\rho^{G}) \left(\overline{G_Y}\right) + \rho^{G} \left(\frac{g_{t-1}}{y}\right) + \varepsilon^{G}_{t} \label{eq:NewKeynesian.FiscalPolicyRule.spending}
\end{align}
where \(\overline{G_Y}\) is the target ratio of government spending to output,
\(\rho^{G}\) a persistence parameter
and \(\varepsilon^{G}_{t}\) is an exogenous deviation to the rule.

  or in per-capita terms:
\begin{align}
k_{t} := \frac{1}{n}\int_{0}^{n} K_{t}[h] dh = \frac{1}{n}\int_{0}^{n} K^{d}_{t}[m] dm =: k^{d}_{t} \label{eq:NewKeynesian.CapitalMarketClearing}
\end{align}

\paragraph{Labor market}
The supply of labor by the households must equal the demand for labor by the intermediate goods sector,
  or in per-capita terms:
\begin{align}
l^{s}_{t} = \frac{1}{n}\int_{0}^{n} L^{s}_{t}[h] dh = \frac{1}{n}\int_{0}^{n} L^{d}_{t}[m] dm = l^{d}_{t} \label{eq:NewKeynesian.LaborMarketClearing}
\end{align}

\paragraph{Goods market}
The final good (in per-capita) is used for consumption, investment and government spending,
  yielding the following resource constraint:
\begin{gather}
\underbrace{\frac{1}{n} \int_{0}^{n} Y_{t}[f] df}_{y_{t}}
= \underbrace{\frac{1}{n} \int_{0}^{n} C_{t}[h] dh}_{c_{t}}
+ \underbrace{\frac{1}{n} \int_{0}^{n} I_{t}[h] dh}_{i_{t}}
+ \underbrace{\frac{1}{n} \frac{G_{t}}{P_{t}}}_{g_{t}}
\nonumber
\\
y_{t} = c_{t} + i_{t} + g_{t} \label{eq:NewKeynesian.ResourceConstraint}
\end{gather}
Total demand for intermediate goods~\eqref{eq:NewKeynesian.Firms.TotalDemand}
  must equal its aggregated supply~\eqref{eq:NewKeynesian.IntermediateFirms.ProductionFunction}:
\begin{align}
\int_{0}^{1} Y^{d}_{t}[m] dm = \int_{0}^{1} Y^{s}_{t}[m] dm \label{eq:NewKeynesian.AggregateSupplyDemand}
\end{align}

\paragraph{Price distortion}
The price distortion \(p_{t}^*\) is defined as the weighted average of the relative price of intermediate goods:
\begin{align}
p_{t}^{*} = \frac{1}{n} \int_{0}^{n} {\left(\frac{P_{t}[m]}{P_{t}}\right)}^{-\epsilon^{P}} dm \label{eq:NewKeynesian.PriceDistortionDefinition}
\end{align}

\subsection{Aggregation and market clearing: exercises}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]

\item
Why do we specify all prices relative to the consumer price index and/or the inflation rate?
  
\item
Show that aggregated real profits of the intermediate firms are given by
\begin{align}
div^{M}_{t} := \frac{1}{n} \int_{0}^{n} \frac{\mathcal{DIV}^{M}_{t}[m]}{P_{t}} dm = y_t - w_t l^{d}_{t} - r^{K}_{t} k^{d}_{t-1} \label{eq:NewKeynesian.IntermediateFirms.AggregateProfits}
\end{align}
Why is \(div^{M}_{t}>0\) in this model?

\item
Show that the resource constraint~\eqref{eq:NewKeynesian.ResourceConstraint} can be derived
  from the aggregated nominal budget constraint~\eqref{eq:NewKeynesian.BudgetNominal}.
Interpret the equation.

\item
Show that~\eqref{eq:NewKeynesian.AggregateSupplyDemand} implies
\begin{align}
p_{t}^{*} y_t = A_t {(k_{t-1})}^{\alpha^{K}} {(l^{s}_{t})}^{1-\alpha^{K}} \label{eq:NewKeynesian.AggregateSupply}
\end{align}
Interpret the equation and explain why \(p_{t}^{*}\) is called the \emph{price efficiency distortion}.

\item
Using the Calvo mechanism, derive the law of motion for the price efficiency distortion:
\begin{align}
p_{t}^{*} = \left(1-\theta^{P}\right) {(\widetilde{p}_{t})}^{-\epsilon^{P}} + \theta^{P} {(\Pi_{t})}^{\epsilon^{P}} p_{t-1}^{*} \label{eq:NewKeynesian.PriceDistortionLoM}
\end{align}

\end{enumerate}
